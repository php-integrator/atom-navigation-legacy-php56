# php-integrator/atom-navigation-legacy-php56
## Legacy
This is a legacy version that requires PHP >= 5.6. Users that are on PHP 7.1 can and should use [the newer version](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

This package only exists to cater towards users that are not in any position to upgrade their host PHP version. As a result, any issues that appear in this package will not be fixed, no new features will be added and no enhancements will be done.

## About
This package provides code navigation for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base-legacy-php56) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

**Note that the [hyperclick](https://github.com/facebooknuclide/hyperclick) package is also required.**

What is included?
  * Navigate to the definition of your global PHP constants and functions.
  * Navigate to the PHP documentation of built-in classes and functions.
  * Navigate to the definition of classes, traits and interfaces.
  * Navigate to the definition of class, trait and interface members.

Note: The exact modifier key (ctrl, alt, shift, meta, ...) to hold whilst clicking depends on your configuration of the hyperclick package.

Tip: You can also navigate to the names of classes, interfaces and traits inside docblocks! If an item is *navigable*, it will be underlined when moving your mouse over it while holding the alt modifier key.
